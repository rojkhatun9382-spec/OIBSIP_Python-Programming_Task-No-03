# OIBSIP_Python-Programming_Task-No-03
Objective : The aim of this program is to generate a random password based on the user’s choice of length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters).

Steps Performed : 1. The program asks the user for the desired password length. 2. It checks if the length is valid (must be a positive number). 3. The user selects which character types to include (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols). 4. A character pool is created based on the selected options. 5. If no character type is selected, the program shows a warning and stops. 6. The program uses secrets.choice() to randomly pick characters from the pool. 7. The final password is displayed to the user.

Tools Used : 1. Python programming language 2. String module → provides character sets (ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits, punctuation). 3. Secrets module → generates secure random characters. 4. Input/Output functions (input(), print()) → for user interaction. 5. Conditional statements (if-else) → for handling user choices and validation.

Outcome : 1. The program generates a secure random password according to user preferences. 2. It prevents invalid inputs (like zero length or no character type). 3. The user receives a strong password that can include letters, numbers, and symbols depending on their selection.
